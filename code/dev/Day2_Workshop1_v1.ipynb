    "Neural coding describes how neurons represent information about the world. Coding can be studied by asking whether external or internal events lead to changes in neural activity (<b>encoding</b>), or by asking whether different types of information can be read out from neural activity (<b>decoding</b>). In this workshop we will address the question of neural encoding, with a focus on single cell encoding models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding of <b>sensory</b> information has been studied for decades by presenting animals with stimuli and observing how the activity of individual neurons changes. To study encoding of <b>motor</b> variables, researchers train animals to perform a behavior (or observe naturalistic behaviors) and correlate the animals' movement with changes in neural activity. Recent research has demonstrated that even sensory areas have representations of motor and behavioral variables, and vice versa. This is often called \"multiplexed\" coding. Furthermore, neural encoding can be influenced by <b>cognitive</b> processes such as learning, task engagement, and decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact form of neural activity changes is also a part of the study of neural coding. Neurons can represent information based on their average firing rates over a period of time, based on the precise spike times relative to some event, using bursts of spikes, or based on synchrony and timing relative to global population activity. In this workshop, we will consider <b>average firing rates</b> as they relate to information coding.\n",

Instead, we need to use an optimizer to solve for $\\beta$ in this new non-linear case. Such solvers work by maximizing the likelyhood (or equivalently minimizign the negative log-likelihood) of potential $\\beta$ values for a given dataset. If $g(*)$ describes variance models from the exponential family of distributions, it can be shown that convergence is garanteed for this optimization problem.\n",
